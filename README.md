is a multi use bot using the discord.py library

Clone this project to get started, enter your token into token.txt make sure the python path is correct if starting from sh, and then install the dependancies in requirements.txt. That is all the preparation you need and now you can start it by running startbot.sh. <br>
the webapp folder uses flask to host a webserver with basic info links for the bot so if I dont have the website ready by now then you can run that and see the website <br>
if you dont want to host it yourself you can use the offical one <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=832946537323167785&permissions=8&scope=bot" target="_blank">Here</a> <br>
